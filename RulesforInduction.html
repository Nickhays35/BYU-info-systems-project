            <h3>This is the Rules for Induction Page</h3>
            <div style="background-color: aquamarine;"><p>Induction of a player into the Hall of Fame hinges on whether they qualify, and whether the writers voting for them think they deserve induction. Being eligible in the first place is relatively difficult as players must have been in the league for at least 10 seasons. Given that the average player debuts at 26, and the couple thousand of players in the minor leagues most of which whom are younger, reaching 10 years service time is a difficult task. If a player is eligible and they recieve <b>75% of the writers vote,</b> they get to join the exclusive club.</p></div>
