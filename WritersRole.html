            <div style="background-color: aquamarine;"<p>Writers are selected by the writers association typically due to the quality of their coverage of particular teams or the league as a whole. The reason why the hall of fame selection process is performed exclusively by the writers is because they were dreamed to be more knowledegable than the average fan given their job is to follow and cover the players throughout their careers.</p></div>
